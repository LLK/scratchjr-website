                    In this more in-depth assessment, students can build on the
                    Reverse Engineering Solve-It activities they did with the
                    YouTube videos. This assessment can be off-screen, if you are
                    able to project videos on a projector. Students view a full-screen
                    ScratchJr project without seeing the code for the characters&apos;
                    programs. They then reconstruct the scripts of the project
                    using pre-printed blocks, provided at the end of the document...
