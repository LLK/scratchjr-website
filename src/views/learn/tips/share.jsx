                    to send your project, the recipient tablet must have ScratchJr

                    the recipient must both be iPads.

                    sharing the project with others.

                    ScratchJr doesn't number or rename the project on the target
                    device, so if you send it lots of times you can end up with
                    multiple copies of the same project. ScratchJr treats each
                    copy as a separate project even if each copy has the same
                    name, so if you make any changes to a project make sure to
                    rename it before you share it so that the recipient can
                    distinguish between the versions.
