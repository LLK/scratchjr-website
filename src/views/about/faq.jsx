                        <div className="content-description-answer">
                            ScratchJr runs on both iPads and Android tablets. It will run on any iPad 2 or later,
                            including all iPad minis, with iOS 7.0 or later installed.
                            Note that newer versions of ScratchJr will only run on
                            iOS 8+. It also runs on any
                            Android tablet, 7-inches or larger, that are running Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean MR1)
                            or higher. It does not need web-access to run.<br />
                            We recommend iPads running iOS 9 or greater and Android tablets
                            running Android 5 (Kit Kat) or higher.

                            This version was built from the Android version. We have had to remove some features,
                            such as sharing, due to differences between Android and Chrome OS. We are providing
                            this application <b>AS IS</b>. If you run into problems, please do let us know, but
                            we cannot promise that we will fix bugs in this version.<br />
                            If you have a Chromebook that can install Android apps from the
                            Play store, we recommend that you install that version.

                            does meet the minimum requirements (7-inch tablet) running Android 4.2 or greater,
                            and you are willing to side-load the apk, you can download and install a copy of

                            If ScratchJr can&apos;t record sounds or take a picture with the camera, it might be

                            downloaded the app. You can change this by going
                            to <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera</em> on your device.
                            If the ScratchJr toggle is off, turn it on. Do the same for the microphone,
